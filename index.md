## Executive Summary

I am a highly motivated and experienced leader with a strong commercial and entrepreneurial background. I have worked in the FMCG, Tech, Health & Wellness and Retail industries and developed a wide range of experience from working in global, regional and local assignments always with a focus in developing new business. Currently, I am setting up MC Sonae's Vertical Integration Business Unit area where I will be assessing, developing and implementing production projects to improve the value proposition we offer our clients. 
I have a growth mindset and am always looking for opportunities to learn new skills both at a professional and personal level. What I love the most about my job is that it allows me to learn from the people I work with and teams I lead, while at the same time allowing me to share my experience and improve the performance of the businesses I work with. 
Married and a father of two girls, I am lucky to be able to share my time between work, family and hobbies. We love to travel together and see novel places and I am an avid kitesurfer.
